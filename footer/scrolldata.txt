Atari Invasion on Tour (UK edition).
 - 
We are a group of Atari (8-bit) enthousiasts from the Netherlands that have been in contact on and off since the 80s. Nowadays we meet at the HCC Commodore ig meetings in Maarssen (NL). Here we performed our first and second Atari Invasions to show that the Atari legacy lives on!

        "en": "As far as we know, the last batch of the Turbo-Freezer was produced in 2016.\n \nAll rights from its designer Bernhard Engl were transferred to the ABBUC in 2004. A couple of ABBUC members created a new revision (2005) with a lot more functionality.\n \nIn 2011 another overhaul was performed, due to scarcity of components used in the 2005 edition.\n \nThe idea of a Freezer is that it enables you to stop CPU execution and dump memory or adjust registers. It allows you load/save the machine state and can be a useful tool to debug or crack software. Or you could cheat at games by updating the number of lives, or disable collision detection altogether."

        "en": "The Atari VCS/2600 consoles lack a pause feature. This is solved with a simple modification called the 'pause mod'. With it you can finally go the bathroom in the middle of a record high-score attempt!\n \nWe brought with us both the pause mod by 'vintage gaming and more' as well as the OSH Park PCB only version.\n \nThe installation manual by 'vintage gaming and more' covers the various 2600 systems and can be found on their website."

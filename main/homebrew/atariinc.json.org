Design changes led to non working peripherals (Atari and 3rd party) and OS changes also resulted in incompatible software.\n \nThe press warned Atari of the hefty price tag, by comparison, the 800 it should supersed was sold at less than $700. It is told that people started hoarding the 800 machines, afraid the machine would disappear soon.\n \nThe 1200XL is not released in a PAL version."

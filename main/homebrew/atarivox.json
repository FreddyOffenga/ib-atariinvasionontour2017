        "en": "The AtariVOX+ adapter is a neat gadget. The on-board Speak-Jet chip provides \u2018AtariVOX Enhanched\u2019 games with speech synthesis like in the 80s. The same chip has some on-board sounds and also can be used as a 5 channel music synthesizer.\n \nThe AtariVOX+ can be used with 2600, 7800 and Vectrex consoles. When used with the 7800 or Vectrex you will need a piece of joystick extension cable, or you can remove the casing.\n \nAnd lets not forget to mention the 32kB FLASH memory, that some games use to store high-scores. The AtariVOX+ is available from the Atari Age store."
